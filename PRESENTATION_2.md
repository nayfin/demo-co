# Part 2: Adding Documentation Using Storybook

## Setup Storybook

See [nx docs](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/plugins/storybook/overview) for more information.

### 1) Add the Storybook plugin and addons to dev dependencies


```bash
npm i -D @nrwl/storybook @storybook/essentials
```

### 01-installs-storybook

Run Nx storybook schematic

```bash
nx g @nrwl/angular:storybook-configuration <project-name>
```

Now run storybook

```bash
nx run <project-name>:storybook
```

And we get an error, but this expected as our component depends on the `ReactiveFormsModule` and we haven't provided it in the story's configuration.


### 02-import-required-modules

So import `ReactiveFormsModule` in the story and add it to the `moduleMetadata` property of the `primary` story.


```ts
// text.component.stories.ts
export const primary = () => ({
  moduleMetadata: {
    imports: [
      ReactiveFormsModule
    ]
  }
})
```

You'll notice the `knobs` generated in our story by the nx schematic. While these are great, Storybook is evolving rapidly, and the `knobs` API is being replaced with a new `controls` API.

### 03-convert-to-templated-stories

  Soon well replace the `knobs` with some `controls` but first let's just remove the `knobs` and create a template for our stories that we can use to represent different states. Replace entire `text.component.stories.ts` file with the following:

```ts
import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { IStory, Story } from '@storybook/angular';
import { TextComponent } from './text.component';

export default {
  // The title in sidenav for our group of stories for this component
  title: 'Editable Text Component'
}

// A template we can reuse to easily create a new story to represent each state of our component
const template: Story<TextComponent> = (args: TextComponent): IStory => ({
  // The component the story represents
  component: TextComponent,
  // Module dependencies can be configured here
  moduleMetadata: {
    imports: [ReactiveFormsModule]
  },
  // Declare property values that should be duplicated across stories here
  props: {
    textValue: 'initialValue',
    ...args
  }
});

// story representing editing state
export const editing = template.bind({});
editing.args = {
  state: 'editing',
};

// story representing editing state
export const displaying = template.bind({});
displaying.args = {
  state: 'displaying',
};

// story representing editing state
export const updating = template.bind({});
updating.args = {
  state: 'updating',
};
```

Now we have story to represent each state of our component. Next let's add the `essentials` addon and see what that gets us.

### 04-add-storybook-essentials

We already installed `@storybook/essentials` earlier, so we just need to update the configuration to use this API and we'll get a docs out of it for free.

First, replace `knobs` addon with `essentials` in `<workspace-name>/.storybook/main.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  stories: [],
  addons: [
    "@storybook/addon-essentials"
  ]
};
```

Then, remove everything from `libs/<library-name>/.storybook/preview.js` but don't remove file, we'll need it later.

### 05-enhance-docs-with-compodoc

Compodoc is a great to for auto generating docs. We can leverage its output here so that we can enhance the docs generated by storybook.
```bash
nx add @twittwer/compodoc
nx g @twittwer/compodoc:config <project-name>

```

### 3) Setup some stories

We'll start by adding some actions. Actions allow us to hook into the methods of our component, we'll use them to check the values emitted by our outputs. We'll make it easy to reuse them by creating an object of our actions

```ts
const actionsData = {
  updateText: action('updateText'),
  cancelEdit: action('cancelEdit'),
  startEdit:  action('startEdit')
};
```

We'll tell Storybook not to try and render these actions by adding the `excludeStories` property to the default export

```ts
export default {
  title: 'TextComponent',
  component: TextComponent,
  excludeStories: /.*Data$/, // Tells storybook to not render anything that ends with `Data`
}
```







<!-- #### NOTE: Compodoc can be run with the following commands
    ```bash
    // HTML Format
    nx run <project>:compodoc
    // JSON Format
    nx run <project>:compodoc:json
    ``` -->

### 5) Configure Storybook to integrate with Compodoc

Configure storybook-watch & storybook-build targets in angular.json:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "<project-name>": {
      "architects": {
        "storybook": {
          /* existing @nrwl/storybook config */
        },
        "build-storybook": {
          /*  existing @nrwl/storybook config */
        },
        "compodoc": {
          /* existing @twittwer/compodoc config */
        },
        "storybook-watch": {
          "builder": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
          "options": {
            "commands": [
              "npx nx run <project>:compodoc:json-watch",
              "npx nx run <project>:storybook"
            ]
          }
        },
        "storybook-build": {
          "builder": "@nrwl/workspace:run-commands",
          "options": {
            "commands": [
              "npx nx run <project>:compodoc:json",
              "npx nx run <project>:build-storybook"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Configure Storybook Docs in libs/<project-name>/.storybook/preview.js:

```ts
import { setCompodocJson } from '@storybook/addon-docs/angular';
import compodocJson from '../../../dist/compodoc/<project-name>/documentation.json';

setCompodocJson(compodocJson);

```

### 4) Run Storybook

```bash
nx run <project-name>:storybook
```
